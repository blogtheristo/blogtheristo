#### A Legacy of Stewardship

Since our inception, Lifetime World has embarked on a journey of environmental conservation, fueled by a profound belief in the interconnectedness of all living things. We recognize that our planet is not merely a resource to be exploited but a sanctuary to be cherished.

Combating Climate Change: a Top Priority

Climate change looms as the most pressing threat to our planet's future. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting glaciers are just a few of the consequences of our carbon emissions. Lifetime World is committed to mitigating climate change by promoting renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and advocating for sustainable practices.

Erosion: A Silent Threat

Erosion, the gradual wearing away of land, is a silent yet devastating force. It threatens fertile soils, disrupts ecosystems, and contributes to flooding. Lifetime World works tirelessly to combat erosion by promoting soil conservation techniques, planting trees, and restoring degraded landscapes.

Drought: A Parched Planet

Drought, characterized by prolonged periods of insufficient rainfall, is a growing concern, affecting millions of people around the world. Lifetime World is at the forefront of drought resilience, promoting water conservation, developing drought-resistant crops, and implementing rainwater harvesting systems.

Our Path Forward: A Collaborative Research Effort

We recognize that the challenges we face are too immense to be tackled alone.
Lifetime World fosters partnerships with individuals, communities, businesses, and governments, creating a united front to address environmental issues.
Feel free to discuss intern opportunities to learn together.

Empowering Future Generations

Education is the cornerstone of environmental stewardship. Lifetime World equips young minds with the knowledge and skills to become responsible stewards of our planet, ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.

Our Impact: A World in Harmony

With each tree planted, every watt of renewable energy generated, and every drop of water burned from hydrogen, or conserved, we are weaving a tapestry of environmental restoration.

Lifetime World envisions a world where nature thrives, communities flourish, and humanity lives in harmony with its surroundings.

## Join Us in Our Mission

Together, we can create a world where climate change is a distant memory, erosion is a relic of the past, and drought is a forgotten nightmare. Together, we can make our planet a beacon of hope for generations to come.

Lifetime World Advisors are the champions for Earth's health, stewards of a sustainable future.

# Interesting to Me

## Building the DWS 6.0 Platform for Intelligent Industries for Sustainability

### Solving the Climate change

There is a need for a global industrial map application similar to a covid-map.
An application that shows in real time every carbon-emissive device operating.
An app that shows a dashboard and its wall of carbon emission reductions and improvements on a map showing the local situation.  
A virtual reality platform (DWS) can solve this need.
There will be consumer competitions available,
Environmental prizes,
wall of fame for cities, companies, products, people, and more.
Because your device operating and causing emissions is the problem, it will be addressed soon.
What is measured and followed are sooner fixed.
Let's make this a fun journey 🥰😊🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀.
Achievements work better than restrictions.
Use of an intelligent building ecosystem using 5G/IoT Sensors (Wirepas) and fuel cells ecosystem.
