# Interesting to me

## Hydrogen economy reducing co2 emissions

### Solving the Climate challenge

There is a need for a global industrial map application similar to covid-map that.  
shows in real time every carbon emissive device operating.

App where its a wall of improvement locally can be seen.

Virtual Reality platform dws4 solves this need;

There will be consumer competitions available,

Environmental prizes,

Wall of fame cities, companies, products, people, what not.

Because your device operating causing emissions are the problem; it will be addressed;   
soon.

What is measured and followed are sooner fixed.

Lets make this a fun journey ü•∞üòäüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ. 

achievements vs. restrictions do work better.

Free for contributors to write and use.

Use of an intelligent building ecosystem using 5G/IoT Sensors (Wirepas) and fuel cells ecosystem. 

## Skills

Please contact me if there is need special talent. We have quite good network for many project work.
