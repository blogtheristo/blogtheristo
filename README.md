# Interesting to me

## Building the DWS platform for the intelligent industries of the Hydrogen economy age

### Solving the Climate change with dws build challenge

There is a need for a global industrial map application similar to covid-map that.
Application that shows in real time every carbon emissive device operating.
App that shows a dashboard and its wall  carbon emission reductions / and improvements on a map showing local situation.  
Virtual Reality platform dws can solve this need;
There will be consumer competitions available,
Environmental prizes,
Wall of fame cities, companies, products, people, what not.
Because your device operating causing emissions are the problem; it will be addressed;
soon.
What is measured and followed are sooner fixed.
Lets make this a fun journey 🥰😊🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀.
achievements vs. restrictions do work better.
Use of an intelligent building ecosystem using 5G/IoT Sensors (Wirepas) and fuel cells ecosystem.
